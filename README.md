Hey, I'm genaralskar and I make video games! I'd like to take some of the stuff I've learned over the years and share it with you!

I'll be making tutorials on a wide variety of topis, all mostly focused on game development. This includes software like Unity, Maya, Houdini, Substance Painter/Designer, and more. Topics might include scripting, modeling, shaders, whatever I think would be good to know.

You can check out my YouTube channel with all my tutorials here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFH5l_TN4gjH4pC3S9CWRzg

If there's something you want to know, let me know and I'll see if I can do it!
